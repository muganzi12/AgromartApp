                 <h3>Agromart Company Limited</h3>
                 <p>
                  AGROMART is an agricultural marketing company operating in both the rural and urban parts of Uganda, established to improve the agricultural market of the economy of Uganda through    connecting commercial farmers and linking them to market centers and buyers through a mobile APP . The company was established in march-2018 and it has now 285 registered members with over 100 women applying for membership. The ﬁrst goal is to help improve the agricultural market of the economy and create employment opportunity.  It will also enable them to discover the value of voluntary service and helps to foster a sense of community and active citizenship. This is a pro-youth lead, business organization which was created by a group of young men who felt the need to address issues affecting the agricultural sector which is the back bone of this country’s economy. Production and Marketing aspects of agricultural produce are intertwined with each other. Market-driven production rather than production–propelled marketing is the order of the day. Under the present dispensation, the agriculture and allied departments dealing with production enhancement are totally dissociated from the marketing setup. This has led to conspicuous absence of integration in planning and implementation of different schemes at district level. The need of the hour is to bring convergence amongst agriculture and allied departments in marketing of agricultural produce.
